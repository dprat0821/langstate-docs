### The Role of Evaluation in Software Applications

Evaluation is a critical foundation for the **continuous improvement of software applications**. Just as testing and benchmarking underpin the reliability of conventional systems, systematic evaluation ensures that software maintains **quality, consistency, and usability** as it evolves. Accurate evaluation provides the feedback loop needed to refine models, components, workflows, and user experiences — forming the basis for **data-driven iteration and deployment confidence**.

### Why Evaluation of LLM Applications Is Complex

However, evaluating LLM-driven systems is far more complex than evaluating traditional software. Conventional programs produce deterministic outputs that can be verified through well-defined rules or unit tests, while language models generate **probabilistic, context-dependent, and multi-modal responses**. Several factors contribute to this complexity:

1. **Non-determinism** – The same prompt can yield different valid outputs due to model randomness, context drift, or temperature settings.
2. **Open-endedness of responses** – There are often multiple “correct” answers or formulations, making exact matching ineffective.
3. **Contextual dependency** – Model quality depends on conversation history, user intent, and implicit world knowledge, all of which are difficult to reproduce precisely.
4. **Subjectivity in quality judgment** – Criteria such as helpfulness, tone, or creativity rely on human or LLM-based interpretation rather than hard logic.
5. **Multi-turn entanglement** – In conversational settings, evaluation must account for how each turn contributes to the evolving goal, not just the final answer.

These factors make it difficult to isolate and measure improvement objectively, slowing feedback cycles and inflating evaluation costs.

### Current Industry Practice

In practice, the industry has adopted several frameworks to standardize and automate evaluation for LLMs. Systems such as **Ragas**, **TruLens**, **DeepEval**, **PromptLayer**, and **Evals (OpenAI)** enable model-level and application-level monitoring. They typically rely on **prompt–completion pair evaluation**, **tool-selection accuracy**, and **retrieval quality assessment** — comparing generated outputs against reference answers or judging them using _LLM-as-a-judge_ scoring metrics such as _relevance_, _coherence_, _faithfulness_, and _groundedness_. Some incorporate _human-in-the-loop_ pipelines or synthetic test suites that evaluate model performance on various tasks.

### Resulting Challenges

Despite these advances, several core challenges remain for evaluating modern LLM applications:

1. **Evaluation Subjectivity** – Assessments often depend on interpretive scoring rather than deterministic criteria, reducing reliability.
2. **High Evaluation Cost** – Human or model-based judging incurs substantial time and token costs.
3. **Lack of Granular Control** – Most frameworks treat entire conversations as atomic units, making it hard to analyze intermediate reasoning or state transitions.
4. **Limited Structural Awareness** – Evaluators focus on surface text quality rather than the correctness or consistency of the underlying structured artifact.
5. **Non-reproducible progress** – Without explicit state tracking, evaluators cannot isolate where a conversation improved or regressed.

Together, these issues stem from the inherently **unstructured nature of conversational outputs**. In many real-world applications, the goal of interaction is not arbitrary dialogue but the **co‑construction of structured artifacts** — such as registration
